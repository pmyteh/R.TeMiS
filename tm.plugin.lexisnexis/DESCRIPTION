Description: Provides a 'tm' Source to create corpora from
  articles exported from the 'LexisNexis' content provider as
  HTML files, and as .docx files from LexisNexis Advance.
  It is able to read both text content and meta-data information
  (including source, date, title, author and pages).
  Note that the file format is highly unstable: there is no warranty
  that this package will work for your corpus, and you may have
  to adjust the code to adapt it to your particular format.
